### 4.3 User and Team Management (Priority: High)

- Enable subscription renewal and upgrade workflows
- Provide subscription usage tracking and analytics

### 4.6 Product Catalog Management (Priority: Medium)
- Maintain centralized product catalog with module definitions

### 4.7 File Management (Priority: Medium)
- Support unified file upload with configurable presets

- Support offline payment processing workflows
- Provide billing history and payment tracking
- Enable invoice customization and branding

### 4.9 Data Management (Priority: Critical)
- All data entities across the platform must support soft-delete operations. When an entity is deleted, it should be marked with a `deletedAt` timestamp but remain in the database.
- By default, restoration of soft-deleted data is not a user-facing feature. Specific exceptions with versioning and restoration capabilities (e.g., for Agents and Flows) are detailed in their respective PRDs.
